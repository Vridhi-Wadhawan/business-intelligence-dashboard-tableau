# Business Intelligence Dashboard Portfolio (Tableau)

This repository presents a curated collection of **business intelligence case studies** developed using Tableau.

The dashboards were created across multiple academic evaluations (assignments, quizzes, and final examination), and collectively demonstrate applied skills in data storytelling, KPI design, and interactive dashboard development.

Rather than representing a single project, this repository functions as a **dashboard portfolio** highlighting analytical thinking and visualization design across different business problems.
