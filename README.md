# Business Intelligence & Data Visualization Portfolio (Tableau)

This repository contains a structured collection of **Tableau dashboards developed across multiple academic evaluations**, including:

- Quiz 1  
- Quiz 2  
- Individual Assignment  
- Final Examination  

Each set of dashboards was built independently under evaluation conditions to solve a specific business problem using data visualization and analytical reasoning.

Rather than a single project, this repository demonstrates **consistency in analytical thinking across multiple business contexts**.

## Portfolio Structure

The dashboards included in this repository were created as part of graded assessments and represent:

- KPI-driven executive dashboards

Each evaluation required:
- Independent problem framing
- Metric selection
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Visual storytelling under time constraints
